# Sign Language Recognition (SLR) System

## Overview
This project aims to enhance communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities by developing a **Sign Language Recognition (SLR) System**. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **OpenCV**, this system translates sign language gestures into text or speech.

## Features
- Real-time gesture recognition using a webcam or pre-recorded videos.
- Translation of recognized gestures into text or speech.
- User-friendly interface for gesture input.
- Scalable architecture for adding new sign gestures.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV for gesture detection and preprocessing
- **Data Manipulation:** NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.8)
- pip

### Clone the Repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sign-Language-Recognition.git
$ cd Sign-Language-Recognition
```


### Additional Setup
Download and extract the dataset (if applicable) into the `data/` directory. Pre-trained models will be automatically downloaded or trained if not present.


### Testing
Run the unit tests to ensure the system is functioning as expected:
```bash
$ python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Dataset
This project uses a publicly available dataset or custom-created images/videos of sign language gestures. Please ensure compliance with any dataset usage terms.
